class WhittakerSmoother:
    """A new Whittaker-Eilers smoother and interpolator.

    The smoother is configured through it's `lambda` and it's `order`. `Lambda` controls the smoothness of the data (1e2~1e4) and `order` controls
    the order of which the penalities are applied (generally 2~4). The smoother can then be configured to weight measurements between 0 and 1
    to interpolate (0 weight) or to complete trust (1 weight) the measurement. The smoother can handle equally spaced measurements by simply not passing
    an `x_input` or unequally spaced data by providing the sampling times/positions as `x_input`.

    The smoother parameters can be updated using the provided functions to avoid remaking this costly struct. The only time the WhittakerSmoother should be
    remade is when the data length has changed, or a different sampling rate has been provided.

    Parameters
    ----------
     lmbda : Controls the smoothing strength, the larger, the smoother. Try 1e2~2e4 to start with and adjust based on the result. `lmbda` must be positive.
     order : The order of the filter. Try 2~4 to start with. Order must be positive.
     data_length : The length of the data which is to be smoothed. Must be positive.
     x_input : The time/position at which the y measurement was taken. Used to smooth unequally spaced data. Must be monotonically increasing.
     weights : The weight of each y measurement."""

        This function will run the smoother and assess the cross validation error on the result. This is defined in Eiler's
        2003 paper: "A Perfect Smoother".  It involves computing the "hat matrix" or "smoother matrix" which inverses a sparse matrix. The
        inverse of a sparse matrix is usually dense, so this function will take much longer to run in comparison to just running `smooth`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        y_vals: The values which are to be smoothed and interpolated and have their cross validation error calculated.

        This function runs the smoother for lambdas varying from 1e-2 to 1e8 in logarithmic steps of 0.5. It computes the
        hat/smoother matrix and finds the optimal lambda for the data. If the time-series exhibits serial correlation the optimal
        lambda can be very small and mean the smoothed data doesn't differ from the input data. To avoid this, use `break_serial_correlation = true`

        It will return the smoothed data, lambda, and cross validation error for each lambda tested!

        As the smoother matrix requires the inversion of a sparse matrix (which usually becomes a dense matrix), this code is extremely slow compared to smoothing
        with a known lambda. Use sparingly!

        ----------
        y_input: The values which are to be smoothed, interpolated, and cross validated for a variety of lambdas.
