/// A new Whittaker-Eilers smoother and interpolator.
///
/// The smoother is configured through it's `lambda` and it's `order`. `Lambda` controls the smoothness of the data (1e2~1e4) and `order` controls
/// the order of which the penalities are applied (generally 2 - 4). The smoother can then be configured to weight measurements between 0 and 1
/// to interpolate (0 weight) or to complete trust (1 weight) the measurement. The smoother can handle equally spaced measurements by simply not passing
/// an `x_input` or unequally spaced data by providing the sampling times/positions as `x_input`.
///
/// The smoother parameters can be updated using the provided functions to avoid remaking this costly struct. The only time the WhittakerSmoother should be
/// remade is when the data length has changed, or a different sampling rate has been provided.
///
/// Parameters
/// ----------
///  lmbda : Controls the smoothing strength, the larger, the smoother. Try 1e2~2e4 to start with and adjust based on the result. `lmbda` must be positive.
///  order : The order of the filter. Try 2~4 to start with. Order must be positive.
///  data_length : The length of the data which is to be smoothed. Must be positive.
///  x_input : The time/position at which the y measurement was taken. Used to smooth unequally spaced data. Must be monotonically increasing.
///  weights : The weight of each y measurement.
